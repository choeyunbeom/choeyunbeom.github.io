## Hi, I'm Yunbeom Choe

I'm an MSc student in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Liverpool. I transitioned from Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering (Chonnam National University) to pursue my passion for machine learning and AI.

## What I Work On

My primary focus is on **generative AI** and **deep learning**. I have hands-on experience with:

- **Model Fine-tuning**: Stable Diffusion and Llama 3 using LoRA/QLoRA techniques
- **Model Deployment**: Building and serving ML models with FastAPI
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Autonomous racing agents using PPO and SAC in TORCS simulation
- **Computer Vision**: Diffusion-based image generation (DALL·E 2, Stable Diffusion, Imagen)

## Certifications

- Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900)

## About This Blog

This blog is a space where I document my learning journey in ML/AI — covering model architectures, implementation details, project walkthroughs, and lessons learned from research and coursework.

## Contact

Feel free to connect with me through the links on this page, or reach out if you'd like to discuss anything ML/AI related.
